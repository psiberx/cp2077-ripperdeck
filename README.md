# RipperDeck

RipperDeck is a portable module that allows you to manage your cyberware without visiting ripperdoc. 

- **Equip** and **swap** owned cyberware
- **Unequip** installed cyberware
- **Dispose** unwanted cyberware

## Requirements

- [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks) 1.14.0
- Cyberpunk 2077 1.23

## Installation

1. Download [the release archive](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-ripperdeck/releases). 
2. Extract it into the Cyberpunk 2077 installation folder.

You should have `<Cyberpunk 2077>/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/mods/RipperDeck` directory now. 

## Usage

RipperDeck integrates into the *Hub* menu.
Open the *Hub* menu to access the new *RipperDeck* section, which repeats the ripperdoc interface with the addition of new actions to unequip and dispose cyberware. 

## Future Plans

- An immersive version in which you have to meet the stats requirements and buy the device from ripperdoc in order to access the respec functions.
